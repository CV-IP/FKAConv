## Dependencies

FKAConv code is actually included in the [LightConvPoint framework repository](https://github.com/valeoai/LightConvPoint).

It is aimed to change in a near future.

LightConvPoint shall be the base library for point cloud processing while FKAConv shall became the repository dedicated to this specific work.

### Examples

We provide examples classification and segmentation datasets:
* ModelNet40
* ShapeNet
* S3DIS
* Semantic8
* NPM3D
